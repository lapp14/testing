# Installation

These files are a complement of the tutorial found in [my blog](http://david-barreto/working-with-sass-bootstrap-and-gulp).

To use it you have to clone the files into your computer and dowload all the dependencies:

```
npm install
bower install
```

To run it, just write `gulp` on your console.
